Gait Analysis Web Application

This document provides an overview of the Gait Analysis Web Application. The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework, and includes a machine learning model to analyze and classify gait characteristics based on sensor data.

1. Objective:
   
The objective of the Gait Analysis Web Application is to assist users in understanding their gait characteristics and providing personalized recommendations to improve their gait patterns, based on data from various sensors.

2. Technologies Used:
	Flask: A Python web framework used to build the web application.
	Pandas: A data manipulation library used to load and preprocess the sensor data.
	Numpy: A numerical computing library used for array operations.
	Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for K-means clustering and data preprocessing.
	Keras: A deep learning library used to build and train the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
	StandardScaler: A preprocessing module from scikit-learn to standardize the data.
	HTML: Used for creating web page templates.
	CSS: Used for styling the web pages.

3. Data and Preprocessing:
   
	The sensor data is loaded from a CSV file named "sensor_data.csv." It contains various gait-related features, collected from different users.
	K-means clustering is performed on the sensor data to group similar gait characteristics. The number of clusters is set to 8, assuming there are 8 different gait characteristics.
	The sensor data is split into features (X) and labels (y), where X represents the gait-related features, and y represents the corresponding gait characteristics.
	The data is preprocessed using StandardScaler to scale the features and bring them to a common scale.

4. LSTM Model:
   
	An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network is implemented using Keras.
	The LSTM model is designed with one LSTM layer with 64 units, followed by a Dense layer with a softmax activation function, which is suitable for multiclass classification problems.
	The model is compiled using sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer.

5. Web Application Routes:
    
	Route `/`: This is the homepage of the web application, which displays a basic HTML template. It serves as an entry point to the application.
	Route `/recommendation`: This route is accessed via a POST request when the user submits the gait-related data through an HTML form on the `/` page. The input data is preprocessed, and the LSTM model predicts the gait characteristic. Based on the prediction, a personalized recommendation is provided to the user.
	Static Files: The web application uses CSS and JavaScript files to style and add functionality to the pages.

6. Detailed Recommendations:
    
The web application provides detailed recommendations based on the predicted gait characteristic. The recommendations are as follows:
	Normal Gait: General advice on maintaining good posture, stride length, and cadence
	Fast Gait: Suggestions to slow down the walking speed for improved stability
	Slow Gait: Tips for increasing walking speed and incorporating regular exercises
	Limb Asymmetry:  Recommendations to improve symmetry between limbs during walking
	Stiff Gait: Suggestions for improving flexibility through stretching and warm-up exercises.
	Ataxic Gait: Encouragement to consult a healthcare professional for coordination and balance issues
	Antalgic Gait: Advice to seek professional evaluation for gait abnormalities.
	Trendelenburg Gait: Guidance to consult a healthcare professional for muscle weakness or imbalances.

7. How to Run the Application:
    
To run the Gait Analysis Web Application, follow these steps:
	Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (Flask, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Keras).
	Place the CSV file named "sensor_data.csv" in the same directory as the application script.
	Execute the script by running the command `python app.py`.
	The application will start, and you can access it by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

8. Note:
    
	The web application is running in debug mode (`app. run (debug=True)`), which provides useful error messages during development but should be turned off in production.
	The dataset used for training and testing the model is assumed to have been preprocessed appropriately before being loaded into the application.
	The accuracy and performance of the machine learning model may vary depending on the quality and quantity of the training data. Continuous improvements and updates may be required for better results.

9. Disclaimer:
    
	The Gait Analysis Web Application is for educational and informational purposes only. The application's recommendations are not meant to replace professional medical advice or treatment. Users with gait abnormalities or medical conditions are strongly advised to consult healthcare professionals for accurate evaluation and personalized recommendations.
